## Project Description

Initially created to be a 'Canvas-killer', we came up with WolfCampus as an alternative to the prominent University web application, Canvas. We did not kill Canvas unfortunately by the end of it,
but the process of learning this tech stack was well worth it. WolfCampus was created for CS425/426 as our capstone project for the Computer Science & Engineering degree program. The main features
are: being able to create an account as a student, join classes that you are in, follow your fellow students in these classes, make posts, upload notes, create textbook reselling posts, and explore
different communities/topics at your university.

At the moment of finishing CS426, our final image for our project is nowhere near close but we have completed as much as we could with the time and obstacles that were given to us. We have received numerous
pieces of advice, advisements, and overall morale support from our faculty which we are forever grateful for; this is the culmination of all of our hardships and sleepless nights.
